## Introduction
* This lesson will walk you through the steps of using Open Refine to cleany messy data that may result from gathering data from other sources or compiling it over time. Examples of messy data include inconsistencies in capitalization, date formats, and alternative spellings for personal names, locations, or organizations. 

## What is OpenRefine?
* OpenRefine is a free, open source tool that is designed to help you clean messy spreadsheet data in large batches rather than one field at a time. It is a an application that is downloaded, but it runs through your web browser offline. In order to run OpenRefine your computer needs to have [Java JRE](https://www.java.com/en/download/)installed, which most computers have installed already.
