## Introduction
This lesson will walk you through the steps of using Open Refine to cleany messy data you may have gathered from other sources or perhaps compiled yourself over time. You will learn how to:

- deleting leading and trailing white spaces
- clean up spelling inconsistencies
- clean up formatting inconsistencies
- split cells into multiple columns

## What is OpenRefine?
OpenRefine is a free, open source tool that is designed to help you clean messy spreadsheet data in large batches rather than one field at a time. 

## Getting Started

### Downloading OpenRefine
You can download the OpenRefine software from http://openrefine.org/download.html for Windows, Macs, and Linux operating systems. For this lesson, we are working with OpenRefine version 3.0 or later. (For Mac users, you may get a message saying it cannot be opened. In this case, go to System Preferences, then Security and Privacy and on the General tab, click lock to make changes, and then click Open Anyway.) 

### Getting the Data
The data we are using for this lesson is the [1890 Oklahoma Territorial Census](https://www.okhistory.org/research/1890), which is a subset of data from [Oklahoma Historial Society's Research Center](https://www.okhistory.org/research/index) that provides online access to a host of historical data related to Oklahoma. 

For this lesson, you can [download the dataset here.](https://github.com/tmcarlisle/OpenRefine-Humanities/blob/master/1890-OK-Census.xlsx) 

## Creating a Project in OpenRefine

Click on Create Project and then Choose Files and upload the 1890-OK-Census file from your desktop.
